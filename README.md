## 🤖⚙️ My Machine Learning Projects

In this section, different sets of machine learning projects are highlighted. Feel free to click on the links for the projects that are highlighted. There is a brief description of the projects along with useful definitions. In the next few sections, a subset of Artificial Intelligence such as __Computer Vision__ and __Natural Language Processing (NLP)__ would be covered along with Data Visualization.

🏚 [__Airbnb House Prices Prediction__]()

* Features such as neighborhood, longitute and latitude could be used to determine the prices of __Airbnb__ houses for hosts.
* __Data Science__ and __Machine Learning__ could be used to extract these insights from data and also make useful predictions for housing prices.
* Since the demand is also an important factor to consider, it becomes really interesting how the prices would vary based on this feature and many others.
* __Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)__ was performed to take a look at features that make the highest impact when determining the prices of houses along with others.

<hr style="border:0.01px solid blue">

## 🗣📣 My Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects

__Natural Language Processing (NLP)__ is converting a natural text into a form that could be used for machine learning and deep learning purposes. It involves extracting texts, removing stopwords, lemmatization and stemming, lowercasing the letters, and removing punctuations and other text information that do not add a lot of meaning in our machine learning predictions. Below are the links to some of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects.

📚 [__Predicting Readability of Texts Using Machine Learning__]   

* Text mining, data visualization, and machine learning can reveal useful insights in the vast amount of text that surrounds us, making it more actionable and useful.
* In addition to this, understanding the difficulty of the text and whether it is at our level could give us good knowledge about the depth of the article.
* Moreover, __libraries__ and other educational institutions could use this information and classify textbooks and notebooks, and separate them based on the difficulty level.
* In this project, machine learning and deep learning algorithms were used to predict the difficulty of texts.
* __Hyperparameter tuning__ was also done to ensure that the models took important features into consideration and made predictions with low __mean squared error__ and __mean absolute error__ respectively.

<hr style="border:0.01px solid blue">

👹 [__Twitter Sentiment Analysis__]

* In __Twitter__, there are comments made for different posts and tweets. Sometimes, there might be negative comments that would change the course of the direction of certain topics.
* It is important to identify comments and extract key features from the text so that positive and negative comments could be separated.
* In this project, we are going to be extracting useful information from texts and understand key components for differentiating between __positive texts__ and __negative texts__.

<hr style="border:0.01px solid blue">

🗞 [__Fake News Prediction__]

* There has been a lot of __fake news__ that is spread to a large number of people on a regular basis, leading to misinformation.
* With the aid of machine learning and data science, it is possible to extract insights from news.
* Classification ML models are used to determine if the given news is fake or not based on a set of factors. 
* Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score are used to analyze different set of algorithms before __deploying__ in production.
* This saves a lot of time for readers as they are not __fed__ with misleading information. 

<hr style="border:0.01px solid blue">

## 👀👁 My Computer Vision Projects

__Computer Vision__ is a subset of artificial intelligence which gives the computer to perform computations and make predictions on image data. If the image of a cat is given, for instance, the computer vision algorithms would classify whether there is a cat in the image based on a previously labeled set of images. Therefore, it is important to give the right data to the computer vision algorithms in order for them to get the right predictions. 

Computer vision offers immense potential and high demand due to its wide range of applications. The abundance of image and video data creates numerous opportunities for leveraging computer vision tools effectively. Here, I present a selection of intriguing projects I have personally undertaken in the field of computer vision.

🎋 [__Wheat Disease Detection Using Transfer Learning__]

* __Wheat__ is commonly available in various forms such as cereals and bread, but it is susceptible to diseases during production.
* Manual identification of wheat diseases is time-consuming for farmers.
* Computer Vision can be utilized to understand and identify different diseases in wheat, leading to significant time savings.
* This technology enables prompt identification of diseases and facilitates preventive measures for future occurrences.
* Several Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like InceptionV3, Xception, and VGG19 were tested to detect wheat diseases.
* VGG19 exhibited exceptional performance, achieving a test accuracy of 97 percent.

<hr style="border:0.01px solid blue">

🔢 [__MNIST Digits Classification__] 

* MNIST data is quite popular as it is being used for beginning the journey with Convolutional Neural Networks.
* The repository contains an MNIST project that would classify the images into __9 digits__ starting from 0 to 9 respectively.
* There are different configurations of Convolutional Neural Networks being implemented by taking into consideration the cross-entropy loss as the metric for getting the best configuration.

<hr style="border:0.01px solid blue">

🕸 [__Convolutional Neural Networks CNN Implementation Using Keras__]

* This is a simple project to implement Convolutional Neural Network and note its working.
* Different layer sizes and different kernels are chosen and trained on a simple dataset. The data that was taken was __MNIST__ which is available in Kaggle.
* There are different kernel sizes considered and outputs are noted using a graph respectively.
* By doing this project, I've learned to use __Keras__ and __Tensorflow__ for building Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) respectively.

## 🕸🔨My Web Scraping Projects

__Web scraping__ is the process of extracting data from websites. This data can be used for various purposes, such as data science and machine learning. There are different methods for extracting data from websites, which may be stored in HTML, XML, or JSON formats. To successfully scrape data from the web, it is important to use the appropriate techniques. Some web scraping projects also involve querying information from the web.

🍿 [__IMDB Movies Web Scraping__]  

* IMDB rating could be used to analyze user engagement with various movies.
* It would be really good if we could be using the tables from the IMDB data and understand the factors impacting the ratings by various users.
* Web scraping was done with the help of various packages in Python and understanding the data respectively.
* One popular library used to understand the data was __BeautifulSoup__ that was important for reading the tables respectively.

<hr style="border:0.01px solid blue">

🍔 [__Restaurant Recipes Web Scraping XML__]

* There are a lot of items being ordered in restaurants and shopping malls.
* The information is stored on the internet.
* As a result, this could be used for various machine learning and deep learning purposes.
* __Web scraping__ of the __XML files__ was performed in this project.
* In addition to this, it was also important to determine the paths needed for robust querying of the data.
* All of these steps were performed with the aid of packages in Python.

<hr style="border:0.01px solid blue">

🎮 [__Popular Gaming Titles Wikipedia Web Scraping__]

* __Wikipedia__ is a good source of information and is often reliable, especially with the trends.
* __Web scraping__ this information could be handy. Web scraping of Gaming data was performed to extract useful insights from it.
